okay - got the math of the decks setup. shuffle and initial deal. all cards an object. the object contains the posistion in the deck. the value of the card 1-13 and suit.
shuffle funciton changes posistion in deck. card obj contains the posistion of the card, so far all = deck. you'll need to finishe writing a function that draws the cards and you'll need to finish the posistion part... player 1...2...3...4.... dealer.... discard etc...
